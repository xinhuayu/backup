<h1>Welcome to my personal pages</h1>

    <p>This is a test page for setting up personal pages on github. </p>
    <p> More to come, about my research and my thoughts. </p>
    <p> I have shared some codes for a few recent projects and you may access them directly through the papers. </p>
    <p></p>
  
    <h1>About me:</h1>
<p>My name is Xinhua Yu. Here are a few things I would like to share with you: </p>
<ul>
    <li><b>My expertises</b>: Epidemiology and big data analytics (mostly structured tabular data).</li>
    <li><b>My math specialty</b>: Probability and statistics,  and some stochastic processes.</li>
    <li><b>My favorite hobby topics</b>: Number theory (more about history, but not about advanced topics) and (classic) geometry (sorry, never learned differential geometry or above). </li>
    <li><b>My favorite readings</b>: Ancient history around the world, currently, Hittites, Scythia and aborigins in western China (recent genetic studies showed they might be there long before people believed). </li>
    <li><b>My best exercise</b>: Learn new programming language to keep my brain active (currently, data analysis with python and mathematical modeling with Julia). </li>
    <li><b>Things most puzzling me</b>: Western European scholars were making astronomical scientific discoveries since the 1600s, while China was stuck with the dark age, and almost nobody in China knew calculus even in the mid 1800s.</li>
    <li><b>People admired</b>: Beethoven, THE pianist who was almost deaf,  Euler, THE mathematician who was blind, and Hawking, THE physicist who was paralyzed. </li>
</ul>
