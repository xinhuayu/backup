<h1>Welcome to my personal pages</h1>

    <p><h1>About me:</h1></p>
<p>My name is Xinhua Yu. Here are a few things I would like to share with you: </p>
<ul>
    <li><b>My expertises</b>: Epidemiology and big data analytics</li>
    <li><b>My math specialty</b>: Probability and statistics,  and some stochastic processes</li>
    <li><b>My favorite hobby topics</b>: Number theory (but not advanced topics) and (classic) geometry (sorry, never learned differential geometry or above) </li>
    <li><b>My favorite readings</b>: Ancienty history around the world, currently, Hittites and Scythia. </li>
    <li><b>Things most puzzling me</b>: Western European scholars were making astronomical scientific discoveries since the 1600s, while China is stuck with the dark age, and almost nobody in China knew calculus even in 1800s.</li>
    <li><b>My best exercise</b>: Learn new programming language to keep my brain active. </li>
</ul>
