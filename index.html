<h1>Welcome to my personal pages</h1>

<p>Here are a few things: </p>
<ul>
    <li>My expertises: Epidemiology and big data analytics</li>
    <li>My math specialty: Probability and statistics,  and some stochastic processes</li>
    <li> My favorite hobby topics: number theory and (classic) geometry (sorry, never learned differential geometry or above) </li>
    <li> My favorite readings: ancienty history around the world. Currently, Hittites and Scythia. </li>
    <li> Things most puzzling me: western European scholars were making astronomical scientific discoveries since the 1600s, while China is stuck with the dark age, and almost nobody in China knew calculus even in 1800s.</li>
